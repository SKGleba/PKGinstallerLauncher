If the PKG gives a error (like leaked sdk theme pkgs), and you are on a retail console, you may try the following:
1) Start the app.
2) Press L Trigger
3) Choose the desired pkgs location.
 - WARNING : Host0 is NOT working while in this mode.
 - It is strongly recommended to reboot after installing all pkgs.
