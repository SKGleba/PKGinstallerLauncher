If the PKG errors out (like leaked sdk theme pkgs), and you are on a retail console, select the "Allow DEV PKGs" option.
 - It is strongly recommended to reboot after installing all pkgs.

# FAQ:
 - Q: Can I install full game pkgs?
   - A: No, its only for DRMFREE and SDK pkgs.
 - Q: Is it compatible with X.XX?
   - A: Yes.
 - Q: I got a black screen after I selected the PKG location and I am using reF00D.
   - A: PKGinstallerLauncher is known to not work when reF00D is enabled. Disable reF00D in your `config.txt`, reboot and try again. Or better, replace it with [0syscall6](https://github.com/SKGleba/0syscall6/releases).
